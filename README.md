# Generative-Models
This project is primarily about using Generative density models (examples: Gaussian Mixture model, Kernel Density model) in the context of Bayesian Inference to predict carcinoma in the Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients database collected by the University of Madrid.  I'm working specifically with this dataset since it only contains 165 patient-records, so it's a fairly small dataset (typical of medical datasets) to apply typical machine learning predictive models such as logistic regression & neural networks.

I'll be using the hcc-dataset.csv provided on Kaggle by Miriam Santos, the author of this particular work on applying a new nearest-neighbor approach to fill in missing data. The HCC dataset will be in this repo as well.
